Bootcamp module 1 challenge - Horiseon webpage refactor


## Description

This project allowed me to draw back on many of the concepts learned in module one and apply those to a refactor of the code for this web page.  Besides consolidating the code, making it easier to follow with comments, and fixing some of the functionality, it also incorporates accessibility features that are important for visitors the page that need that.

I leared how to process a more complex readme file and translate that into actions and tasks, on top of the overall additional practice of working with various HTML elements and CSS styles.

## Features

All images and icons have alt attributes for accessibility.  Navigation bar links work and link to specific content further down in the page.
